MCS-DSS version 2.0.0
_____________________

2014.04.01

Initial commit of the Revised Edition of the  MCS-DSS Application based on Daniel Noll's original 'Heatseeker' application and updated by John Gentle for Dr. Suzanne Pierce.

This version has been modularized and the UI overhauled to use a responsive web design that is fluid and responsive. 

The current functionality of the application is identical to the original Heatseeker. 

This version still has to be further refined to achieve the following:
- improve OOP design and decouple the code
- migrate the code into the target MEAN Web technologies stack
- optimize the applications performance
- better adapt the UI to all target devices
- implement additional technologies and capabilities (D3, ThreeJS, SigmaJS, ScienceJS, KineticJS, Stand Alone Deployment with Native Plugins, etc.)
- further refine the UI and UX.
